# Led Matrix Maker 

Led Matrix Maker is a simple GUI interface for 8x8 Led Matrix (MAX7219) using the [Luma.Led_Matrix library](https://github.com/rm-hull/luma.led_matrix). Inspired by the [Led Matrix Editor](https://github.com/xantorohara/led-matrix-editor), which is an online interface to generate Arduino and C code, Led Matrix Maker allows you to generate Python code ready to be used with luma.led_matrix. 

### TO DO :

* Add multiframes
